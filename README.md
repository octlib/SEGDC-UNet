The EMPS-Augmented dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/liyue123/emps-augmented-pixel.

dataset_EMPS_test.py ：It is the test set data, specifically a series of filenames in the `emps/test.csv` file. 

The functionality of `test.py` is as follows: 
1. Load the `best_model.pth.tar` model; 
2. Load the test set data; 
3. Run the model on all images in the test set and output the average Accuracy, Dice score, Recall, and IoU.
4. The weight file and test dataset can be accessed at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1q4mRJUFz3OFk4V05Uf2X0A
